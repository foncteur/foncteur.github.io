## About me

My résumé is available [here](CV.pdf)! If you want to discuss any topic, or ask any question, feel free to drop me an email at [firstname].[lastname]@proton.me


I'm a queer and autistic person. My pronouns are they/them (or she/her is it's simpler in your language).
I want to be open about my experience and my mental health journey.

Please keep in mind that this is still a recent website, so please be indulgent about what you will find: it’s still an early work in progress, and the projects I’ve linked are quite old.


## Computer science

I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in computer science at [École Normale Supérieure de Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/) and [Université de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/498-2/).

You can find my résumé [here](CV.pdf).

I’m mainly interested in compilers and interpreters, programming languages and functional programming, along with formal verification.

My software projects can be found on [Github](https://github.com/foncteur) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/krokodile). You can find some of my reports (in French) for old programming projects below:

- [Delaunay Triangulation](delaunay.pdf) (OCaml)

- [Raytracing](raytracing.pdf) (C++)

- [Lisp interpreter](lispcpp.pdf) (C++)

You can also find the [report](rapportl3.pdf) and [slides](slidesl3.pdf) (both in French) for my undergraduate research internship.

## Music

I’ve been playing the violin and the (classical) guitar since I was three years old. Additionaly, I also play the piano, the viola, the horn and the trombone, at a teaching level.

My main instruments are the violin and the guitar, which I play at a professional level. During my childhood and teenage years, I have won many first prizes in international competitions, especially in violin (such as, for example, the [Leopold Bellan violin competition](http://www.concoursinternationalleopoldbellan.fr/HISTOIRE.html), which I’ve won when I was eleven).

I’ve also performed a lot as a soloist, with pieces such as Nigun by Bloch, the Mendelssohn concerto, the Sibelius concerto, or various pieces written by Paganini.

I currently play on a violin made by my friend [Luiz Dos Santos](http://dossantosluthier.free.fr/), who is a fantastic luthier who agreed to lend me one of his violins.

I’ve been lucky enough to study with great teachers, such as Mateja Marinkovic, Richard Schmoucler (who is the founder of Sirba Octet), Olivier Charlier, Marie-Annick Nicolas and many others.
